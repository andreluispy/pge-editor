================

1.3.5 (2021-01-20)
==================

- Drop support for Python 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4.
- Accept Unicode parameter values again when performing multipart/form-data
  encoding on Python 2 (broken in 1.3.3).

1.3.3 (2018-07-20)
==================

- Drop support for Python < 2.6.
- Add tox testing support.
- Implement a subset of MIME multipart/form-data encoding locally rather
  than using the standard library's email module, which doesn't have good
  handling of binary parts and corrupts bytes in them that look like line
  endings in various ways depending on the Python version.  [bug=1729754]

1.3.2 (2013-02-25)
==================

- Impose sort order to avoid test failures due to hash randomization.
  LP: #1132125

  with the .parameters() method.

1.1.8 (2010-10-27)
